## Contributing

Uchi is developed following a minimalist philosophy, which dictates keeping the code _simple_, usable and maintainable: this sometimes means giving up certain features.

This is why it is important to discuss whether you want to contribute to the project.

Do not create pull requests out of thin air, as I would hate to close them and waste your time.

TL;DR: any pull requests will be considered only after discussion.
